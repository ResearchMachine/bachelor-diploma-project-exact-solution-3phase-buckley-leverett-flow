### I. Motivation
Methods of underground hydrodynamics for predictive modeling problems often involve solving systems of differential equations. In practice, numerical methods are used. However, such solutions are subject to error.

Sometimes the solution of the differential equation of the model can be obtained in the form of a formula without errors. It is these solutions that are used to test numerical solvers and study the nature of physical processes.

### II. Problem
The main purpose of this work is finding solutions by any math tricks   
Ut+a11(U, V)Ux+a12(U, V)Vx=0,  
Vt+a21(U, V)Ux+a22(U, V)Vx=0.



### III. Key Results 
* Two classes of functions are found for the nonlinear coefficients of systems for which the system is reduced by the method of Riemann invariants to a system for which analytical solutions are known;  
* For the other two classes of functions, solutions of the system were obtained using the Laplace cascade integration method in the hodograph plane;  
* The found classes of functions make it possible to approximate the experimental data with a high degree of accuracy.
